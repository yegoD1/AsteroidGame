# Asteroid Game
A 2D Java game that is a basic asteroid shooter.
## How to Play
Run `TopDownGame.java`, which is contained inside `src/`. Controls are W,A,S,D and spacebar. A and D to turn left and right. W to move forward, S to move backward. Pressing the spacebar will shoot a projectile. Your goal is to get the highest score that you can.
## Rules
As you progress further and further, enemies will start to appear faster and faster. There will also be new types of enemies the further you progress. You have three lives before you lose the game. Taking damage provides you a brief window of invulnerability, denoted by your player turning yellow.

# Remarks
This game was created before 2DGame, for the same purpose of creating an animation project for Academies of Loudoun. You can view that [here](https://github.com/yegoD1/2DGame). This game does have a few issues, such as the player being able to rapidly shoot projectiles by holding down space and the game being unable to handle concurrent inputs. There are also unused files such as `Powerup.java`; I originally wanted to add more functionality, but there was not enough time before the project was due.
